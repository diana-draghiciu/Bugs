# Bugs

A graphical user interface application for a manual testing team.

Bugs (Bugurile) have a name, priority and the steps (separated through comma). 
They are stored in a text file, each bug being on a separate line.

The application permits the user to 
view all bugs (displayed in a QListWidget list) sorted in ascending order according to their priority, 
select a bug and display its reproduction steps, 
delete or move upwards/downwards a selected step.
